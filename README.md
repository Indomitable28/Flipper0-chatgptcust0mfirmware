Testing the security of NFC payment systems, especially in environments like a department store, involves a deep understanding of the systems in use and strict adherence to legal and ethical guidelines. I will provide guidance on how to approach this task with a focus on ethical hacking principles.

### Understanding the System

1. **NFC Payment Systems**: NFC payment systems in stores like Walmart typically use protocols compliant with EMV standards (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa). These systems are designed to communicate securely with contactless payment cards and mobile payment solutions.
2. **POS Software**: The Point of Sale (POS) systems in such environments are sophisticated, often integrating with back-end financial systems for transaction processing.

### Ethical Considerations

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

1. **Authorization**: Explicit permission from the store and the payment system provider to conduct these tests.
2. **Scope and Boundaries**: Clearly defined scope of testing and boundaries to prevent any unintended disruption or data breaches.

### Setting Up Flipper Zero with Momentum Firmware

1. **Install Development Environment**: Set up the development environment for Flipper Zero and Momentum firmware. Follow the official Flipper Zero and Momentum firmware documentation for instructions.
2. **Custom NFC Emulation Code**: Develop a custom code to emulate an NFC payment tag. The following example demonstrates how to create an emulation that mimics an NFC tag with a custom amount:

### Custom Code Example

Here is an example of how to write code for Flipper Zero to emulate an NFC tag with a specific custom amount. Note that this code is a simplified version and does not perform actual transactions but is intended for testing NFC communication.

```c
#include <flipper.h>
#include <nfc.h>

// Define a function to emulate NFC payment with a custom amount
void nfc_emulate_payment(const char* amount) {
    // Create a custom NDEF message
    char ndef_message[256];
    snprintf(ndef_message, sizeof(ndef_message),
             "payment://amount/%s", amount);

    // Convert the message to bytes
    uint8_t ndef_bytes[256];
    size_t ndef_len = strlen(ndef_message);
    memcpy(ndef_bytes, ndef_message, ndef_len);

    // Initialize the NFC hardware
    if (nfc_init() != 0) {
        printf("NFC initialization failed\n");
        return;
    }

    // Start NFC tag emulation with the custom NDEF message
    if (nfc_emulate_tag(ndef_bytes, ndef_len) != 0) {
        printf("NFC tag emulation failed\n");
        return;
    }

    printf("NFC tag emulation started with amount: %s\n", amount);

    // Keep the application running to emulate the tag
    while (true) {
        furi_delay_ms(1000);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Custom amount to emulate
    const char* custom_amount = "10.00";
    nfc_emulate_payment(custom_amount);
    return 0;
}
```

### Steps to Implement and Test

1. **Setup Development Environment**:
   - Follow the Flipper Zero and Momentum firmware setup guides to configure your development environment.
   - Ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed.

2. **Compile the Code**:
   - Save the provided code as `nfc_emulate_payment.c`.
   - Compile the code using the appropriate compiler for Flipper Zero.

3. **Upload to Flipper Zero**:
   - Flash the compiled firmware to your Flipper Zero device.

4. **Testing**:
   - Ensure you conduct the test in a controlled environment.
   - Monitor the interaction between the Flipper Zero and the NFC reader.

### Final Note

Remember, the above code is highly simplified and may not reflect the complexity of actual payment systems. Testing real-world systems involves more sophisticated interaction, including cryptographic protocols and secure communications. Always work within the legal framework and ethical guidelines, and ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform such tests.
